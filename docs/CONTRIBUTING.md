# Contributing to YAGFI

The YAGFI project welcomes contributions from everyone. There are a number of ways you 
can help:

## Suggest labels
Feel free to open an issue with _another one_ custom good-first-issue label with example 
where it's used.

## Frontend issues
Since I'm primarily a backend developer and only studying in frontend, I would be very 
grateful for any help with it.
If you even supply some explanations with your PR - I will marry you (joke (not sure)).

## Backend issues
Although I'm a good (subjectively) Java developer, I have not enough free time to implement 
everything I would like to see in this project.
So, if you found a good issue for you (or just my notes from README) - feel free to 
contact/open an issue and ask any questions if you have some.
